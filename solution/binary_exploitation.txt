$ gdb kill_bang_marry

$ disassemble kill_bang_marry

set breakpoint at nop command
$ break *<address>


enter 80 * "A" as input whem prompted for last name

once breakpoint is hit use the following to view the stack
$ x/88bx $rsp -> to view address

The address we want to overwrite should be bytes 81-88

You should see 80*0x61 (0x61="A") and then a return address

Now just craft the exploit

shellcode + padding = 80 bytes
leaked address = address for lastname buffer

Exploit = shellcode + padding + leaked address


Just write a simple pwntools script to do the exploit on local
from the downloaded file and then upload the file to the target
and run on the target against localhost 4321
